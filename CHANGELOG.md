# `booba-shim` CHANGELOG

All notable changes to booba-shim are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

 * Update the vendored flint-ntcharts compiler to
   [v0.3.0](https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/flint-ntcharts/releases/tag/v0.3.0):
   an opt-in raster renderer. An input with `"renderer": "raster"` compiles to
   flint's ECharts option (`{"echarts", ...}` in place of `{"spec", ...}`) for a
   host to draw as an image; inputs without it compile exactly as before. The
   bundle grows from 233 KB to 734 KB. Read results with flint-ntcharts's
   `envelope.ParseResult`.

## `v0.3.0` - 2026-10-01

 * Update the vendored flint-ntcharts compiler to
   [v0.2.0](https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/flint-ntcharts/releases/tag/v0.2.0):
   new chart types (ECDF, connected scatter, bubble, histogram, area, lollipop,
   calendar heatmap), logarithmic axes, and charts that fill the size they are
   asked for. The compiled spec needs ntcharts v2.6.0 to render.

## `v0.2.0` - 2026-09-30

 * Added [`booba-shim/flintchart`](./flintchart): compile a flint
   `ChartAssemblyInput` (JSON) into an ntcharts render envelope. The
   compiler is a self-contained bundle vendored from
   [flint-ntcharts v0.1.0](https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/flint-ntcharts/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
   (`flint-chart@0.5.1`; see `web/flintchart/PROVENANCE.txt`), so nothing is
   fetched at run time.
   * `examples/flintchart-compile`: minimal browser example proving the
     compile bridge
 * Update DuckDB-Wasm from `1.29.0` to stable `1.32.0`, including the
   embedded workers and WASM artifacts. Keep Apache Arrow JS at `17.0.0`.
 * Update EmbedPDF PDFium from `2.14.2` to `2.15.1`, with matching JS and
   WASM CDN pins. Verified both upgrades in Chrome using the Go/WASM SQL,
   Arrow IPC, and PDF rendering examples; no bridge API changes required.

## `v0.1.0` - 2026-06-13

 * Initial release of `booba-shim`
   * [`booba-shim/duckdb`](./duckdb): DuckDB-Wasm via `database/sql` driver + native Arrow API 
   * [`booba-shim/pdfium`](./pdfium): PDF rasterization to `*image.RGBA` via PDFium-Wasm
